Apple Wired Keyboard w/ Numpad (MB110LL) to Windows Key Mappings
==============================================

This [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts and things work with an Apple Wired Keyboard w/ Numpad (MB110LL) on Windows.

Also includes a few other personal macros that I like (e.g. Spotify).

Installation
------------

- Install [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `MacKeyboard.ahk` file
- Put the `MacKeyboard.ahk` file or a shortcut to the file in your Autostart folder to run it automatically on startup
